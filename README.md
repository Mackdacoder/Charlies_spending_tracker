# Charlie's Spending Tracker
Charlie's Spending Tracker is a personal finance tracker built with Python, Streamlit, and OpenAI's API. This app helps you track all of your credit card expenses, categorize them, and get valuable insights into your spending habits.
Originally designed for Chase credit cards, this app leverages transaction names paired with Chase's pre-designated categories in order to filter your transactions in ways that give a better overview to where your money is actually going.
For all transactions that cannot be categorized, the user has the option to leverage OpenAI to categorize transactions. Each transaction's category can be manually updated later.
